# Day 1 - Pascal - Calibration Values Sum

## Problem Overview
We're reading from input, pulling the numeric values from each line, and summing each line for a total calibration value.

## About Pascal
We're using Pascal for these because I think it's kinda cool, so we'll have to talk through it as we work along.

## Scratchpad
Below are my varied though processes. I don't often do AoC, so be prepared for the mess about to ensue. Sorry in advance.
